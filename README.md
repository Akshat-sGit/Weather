# Weather App 

## Description
A simple weather forecast application for Android using Flutter. The application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it to the user. Users can search for weather forecasts based on location (city) and view the temperature. 


## Prerequisites
1. Flutter SDK
2. Dart
3. Android Studio or Visual Studio Code

## How to run

### 2. Location Screen:    
This is the main screen of the app where you can see the weather of the current location. There are two icons at the top right corner: one to get back to the current location and another to navigate to the city screen, where you can search for any location's weather.

## Conclusion 
Developing this weather forecast application has been an exciting experience. It allowed me to sharpen my understanding of Flutter, while also integrating APIs to fetch and display real-time data. This project was completed as an assignment for Spiderweb Technologies. I am confident that this app demonstrates my technical skills and attention to detail. I look forward to any feedback and hope that you find this application as useful and engaging as I intended it to be. Thank you for the opportunity!
