## Conclusion 
Developing this weather forecast application has been an exciting experience. It allowed me to sharpen my understanding of Flutter, while also integrating APIs to fetch and display real-time data. I am confident that this app demonstrates my technical skills and attention to detail. I look forward to any feedback and hope that you find this application as useful and engaging as I intended it to be. Thank you for the opportunity!
